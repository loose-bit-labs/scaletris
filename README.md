scale-tastic!

A 2D game similar to Tetris where different objects are falling down onto the playfield (ground). The objects are different types of "scales", and you quickly have to click on them and pair them with the identical object on the ground. If the object isn't a scale in any which way, you have to click it and pair it with a trash bin. The scales fall down faster while you go, and you lose ones the stuff on the ground reaches the sky.
Alternatively, any object can fall down from the sky, not related to scales, and you have to scale the objects up or down while they are falling, to match an object already on the ground in size. 2D or 3D objects. If the size is matching at impact, the objects disappear, making room for more objects on the ground.


Something that is easy to play, a reaction-type game. You can learn the rules within a minute, and can play it in between even if you have only a few minutes. We can spend more time to develop the story further, and possibly spend less time in the actual programming.

resize the object as it falls to match the scale of somthing on the ground


a casual game. easy to scale levels by falling speed and number of items
